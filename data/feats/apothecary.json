The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only you or a creature you touch. The extract retains the spell for 8 hours. As an action, a creature can consume the extract to gain the spell's effect (no concentration required), targeting only itself. If the spell requires a saving throw, the save DC equals {@dc 8} + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (choose when you select this feat)."

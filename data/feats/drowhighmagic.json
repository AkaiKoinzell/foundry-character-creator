    "You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the {@spell detect magic} spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn {@spell levitate} and {@spell dispel magic}, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all three spells."

            "When you take the {@action Attack} action on your turn, you can replace a single attack with a magical burst of flame. Each creature of your choice in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability increased by this feat). On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to {@damage 1d8} + your proficiency bonus, and it has the blinded condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. You can use your Searing Ignition a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus (but no more than once per turn), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest."

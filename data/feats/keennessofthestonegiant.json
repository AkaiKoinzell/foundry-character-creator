The attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 60 feet that uses the ability score you increased with this feat as the spellcasting ability. On a hit, the rock deals {@damage 1d10} force damage, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the spellcasting ability modifier) or have the prone condition. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest."
